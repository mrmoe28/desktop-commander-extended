# Browser Automation Options for Desktop Commander

## Current Issue
Puppeteer is having compatibility issues with browser detection. Here are better alternatives:

## Option 1: Playwright (Recommended) ðŸŽ­
**Pros:**
- Better browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- More reliable and faster
- Better error handling
- Auto-downloads browsers
- Works great on M1/M2 Macs

**Installation:**
```bash
npm uninstall puppeteer
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Option 2: Fix Puppeteer Chrome Detection
**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Install Chromium via Homebrew
brew install --cask chromium

# Or use Puppeteer's bundled Chrome
cd /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/desktop-commander
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

## Option 3: Use System Automation (No Browser Needed)
For simple URL opening without automation:
```javascript
import { exec } from 'child_process';

// Open URL in default browser
exec(`open "https://example.com"`); // macOS
exec(`start "https://example.com"`); // Windows
```

## Recommended Solution: Playwright

Replace Puppeteer with Playwright for better reliability:

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

async function openBrowser(url) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ 
    headless: false 
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(url);
  return { browser, page };
}
```

Benefits:
- âœ… Works immediately on M1/M2 Macs
- âœ… Better error messages
- âœ… Faster and more stable
- âœ… Built-in browser downloads
- âœ… Better documentation
